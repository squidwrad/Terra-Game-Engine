# Terra-Game-Engine
I AM AWARE THE CODE IS NON FUNCTIONING RIGHT NOW. I am working on it, i am not a very good programmer XD

A partitioning game engine for physics destruction of geometry.
The goal of this game engine is to be a custom render piepline with partionting in mind, fast pace occlusion and physics calculation, 
current partitioning method is 3D octree however this method has not been implemented yet. 
I am still working on the actual rendering code and finding the correct prorgramming language.

I have created this program multiple times in python, and this is my first attempt at a rust implementation.
I am considering switching to the go programming language out of simplicity as im struggling a lot more than predicted with the rust language.
If there are any recommendations for programming langauge then im more than happy to listen and discuss this.

I am more than happy to coordinate and explain my vision to the best of my ability, of course im more than open to sugestions and ideas.
